This repository demonstrates how to use the `Set` interface in Java and its common implementations such as:

- `HashSet`
- `LinkedHashSet`
- `TreeSet`

## 📌 What is Set in Java?

`Set` is a collection that:
- Does not allow duplicate elements
- Does not guarantee order (except `LinkedHashSet` and `TreeSet`)
- Is part of `java.util` package

## 🛠 Examples

### 1. Removing Duplicates using HashSet

```java
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(list);

You will need this!

Bye!
